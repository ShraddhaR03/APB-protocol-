README - APB Protocol
This repository implements the AMBA APB Protocol using SystemVerilog and UVM methodologies for verification. It provides a testbench for validating the functionality of the APB protocol, including low-power, low-latency operation scenarios. The project includes various components such as drivers, monitors, sequences, and coverage collectors for thorough testing of APB transactions.

Features:
APB Protocol Implementation
UVM-based Testbench for Functional Verification
Coverage and Assertion Integration
Test cases for Read/Write transactions
Files:
apb_driver.sv – Driver implementation
apb_env.sv – Environment setup
apb_seq.sv – Sequence for APB transactions
testbench.sv – Main testbench to run simulations
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Compile the SystemVerilog files using your preferred simulator (e.g., Mentor Questa).
Run the simulation and check the results.
